# Urdu Handwritten Fruit Names Recognition Using CNN (LeNet)

## Project Overview
This project leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to recognize handwritten fruit names in Urdu, utilizing the LeNet architecture. Handwritten text recognition in non-Latin scripts, particularly Urdu, presents unique challenges due to the script's cursive and context-sensitive nature. Traditional Optical Character Recognition (OCR) systems often struggle with Urdu's intricate calligraphy, diverse handwriting styles, and segmentation requirements. This project aims to overcome these challenges by developing a robust recognition system.

## Objectives
- **Preprocessing:** Enhance image quality and segment characters from handwritten samples of Urdu fruit names.
- **Feature Extraction:** Utilize the LeNet architecture, known for its effectiveness in character recognition, to extract relevant features from the segmented characters.
- **Classification:** Train a CNN model to accurately classify the handwritten Urdu characters into corresponding fruit names.
- **Model Optimization:** Fine-tune the model with data augmentation and hyperparameter tuning to achieve high accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of various handwriting samples of Urdu fruit names. These samples undergo preprocessing to improve image quality and segment individual characters.

## Significance
This research not only advances OCR technology for non-Latin scripts but also contributes to the digitization and preservation of Urdu cultural heritage. It has potential applications in educational tools, automated document processing, and multilingual platforms, enhancing communication and information accessibility in Urdu-speaking regions.

## Installation
To run this project, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
After installation, follow the instructions provided in the Jupyter notebooks to preprocess the data, train the CNN model, and evaluate its performance.
